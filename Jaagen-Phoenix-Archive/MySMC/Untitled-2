when he clicks on a an investment or pool link what happens is if no cookie then we check the defaut 
address from the wallet manager when we get it we set it in the cookie and then page load.
if nothing from the manager then we simply ask for an address and follow the old process simply.

we are not creating a wallet manager, we never allow user to enter an addres to send something to... thats way no hacker can 
do anything for we automatically send only to the currentpool address variable and nothing else. 


[[[[[
in the section wallet manager the user can connect Trezor or ledger nano thats it, create a wallet or import  wallet.
you can add address, check balances, update rates becuase we want to see a USD equivalent value.

- he can add wallet
    - generate wallet, provide the seed, keypassword
    - when he will contribute for the first time the address will be registered on the blockchain 
    - we will save on chain : a part of the seed hashed and he must keep another part of the seed if not he looses all. 
        - like that when he connects we will check our contract, pull the part that concern him, and he enters his part
        we construct the whole hash , then we deconstruct the whole hash to seed and we restore the wallet. (safe ?)
