#### ERC20 wallet and native token support
Eth-hot-wallet supports erc20 tokens. From the user side, the tokens will have the same look and feel like Ether. 
To interact with contracts, we use 
```javascript
web3.eth.contract(erc20Abi)
```
Like all other network communication in the wallet, calls to erc20 contracts are done inside `app/containers/Header/saga.js`.
ERC20 Abi can be imported using 
```javascript
import { erc20Abi } from 'utils/contracts/abi';
```




### Todo

- [x] ERC20 native token support
- [x] Local storage
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Event log
- [ ] CI for development and production
- [ ] External security audit
- [ ] Upgrade to react 16
- [ ] Upgrade Enzyme 3


### Development

4 Major containers were created:

- Homepage container - all the actions related to keystore, including manipulation and usage.

- Header container - all the activities related to network communication / web3 API.

- SendTo container - state and actions related to sendTo modal, actual checks and sending is happening in header container.

- TokenChooser container - allows the user to select which erc20 token will be used from a pre-defined list. The list of supported tokens can be found in `app/containers/TokenChooser/token-lists.js`. Each network requires a different list.

#### npm scripts for eth-hot wallet:

`npm run build:dll` to build webpack DLL required for development.

`npm run start` to start development mode. Go to http://localhost:3001 - changes will be reflected in realtime using hot module reloading.

`npm run build` to create bundle for publishing

`npm run generate` to create new components / containers using the generator.

For more documentation regarding the react setup see [react-boiledplate docs](https://eth-hot-wallet.com/docs/react-boilerplate/) here or in the official repo.
